# Polar-Codes Encoding and Decoding using Python

This project is a complete implementation of Polar Codes in Python, focusing on encoding and decoding techniques. Polar Codes are advanced error-correcting codes that improve communication system performance. The encoding process uses both iterative and recursive methods.

# Encoding Methods:
1. Iterative Encoding: Efficient for handling large amounts of data as it saves recursive stack space.
2. Recursive Encoding: Provides a deeper understanding of the algorithm and code structure.

# Decoding Methods:
1. Successive Cancellation (SC) Decoding: A basic but effective method for decoding Polar Codes.
2. Successive Cancellation List (SCL) Decoding: An advanced method that improves decoding by considering multiple paths and pruning the unnecessary paths.
  
# Error Detection: 
Integrated Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) with SCL decoding to reduce errors and ensure messages are received accurately.
